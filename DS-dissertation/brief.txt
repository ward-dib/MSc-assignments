The Covid-19 dataset.

It comprise 2237 patients admitted to the hospital of whom 93 have died.

Data contain a number of comorbidities, corresponding column names are hopefully
self-explanatory (let me know if not). 
The coding for these variables is 1-Yes, 2=No.

The dataset also has Age, ICU (the fact of admission to ICU, we should later
discuss how to better use this), COVID (results of the PCR test), Sex and Days
(number of days between the admission and the Outcome - discharge for whose who survived and
death for those who have died, this is the crucial variable for the survival analysis).

Variable Death present the main outcome - discharge (0) or death (1).

The two directions I was thinking of are 

- predictive modelling (using logistic regression, neural networks, random forest, SVM, etc.)
where the performance will be measured with the combination of sensitivity/specificity and
with the Area under the ROC-curve

- prognostic modelling (Kaplan-Meier curves toe value the effect of each separate
comorbidity on the outcome and Cox regression to predict outcome with time)

The data is to be treated with confidentiality in mind.
